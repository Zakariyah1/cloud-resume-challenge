# Cloud-Resume-Challange
The cloud resume challenge is a challenge by Forrest Brazeal to help people to prepare for a job in the cloud industry. Itâ€™s a great project for those getting into the cloud industry or have a job in tech and want to learn more about Cloud. 

For this challenge I chose to AWS as the cloud provider to complete this challenge. I also used cloudformation as my choice of IaC.
