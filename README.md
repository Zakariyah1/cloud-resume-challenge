# Cloud-Resume-Challange
The cloud resume challenge is a challenge by Forrest Brazeal to help people to prepare for a job in the cloud industry. It’s a great project for those getting into the cloud industry or have a job in tech and want to learn more about Cloud. 

For this challenge I chose to AWS as the cloud provider to complete this challenge. I also used cloudformation as my choice of IaC. 

I have written a blog where I go through this challenge. You’ll find out what I found easy and also what I struggled with. You can find the link to my Blog here ->
