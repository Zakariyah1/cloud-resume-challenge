    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>This is my attempt at the cloud resume challenge. I chose to use AWS to host my website as I wanted to gain more exposure and become familiar with their services.</p>
    <h3>Frontend</h3>
    <p>Setting up the frontend was quite interesting as it is something that I am not used to. As you can probably tell, I'm also not very good at it, which is very evident. For that reason, I have kept it quite simple with basic HTML and CSS. There may be a time when I come back to this website and make it look fancy.</p>
    <p>Setting up CloudFront, S3, and Route 53 was a bit of a challenge, which I could have avoided if I had studied for the AWS CP certification. Nevertheless, I figured it out in no time. I encountered a problem with the content on my S3 bucket and website being different, and I found out that it was due to caching issues.</p>

    <h3>Backend</h3>
    <p>The most difficult aspect of the challenge was writing the Java code to display the visitor count on my website and also writing the Python code to fetch the visitor count and store it in a DynamoDB table. Thankfully, there are many amazing resources out there that helped me get through that difficult period.</p>

    <h3>CI/CD and IaC</h3>
    <p>I decided to use CloudFormation as my IaC tool because I had some prior experience with Terraform, and the documentation was very useful when writing the code. For CI/CD, I decided to go with GitHub Actions. I had a few errors in the beginning as it was my first time using GitHub Actions, but the documentation was very useful, and the error messages were very clear, which made debugging very simple.</p>

    <p>Overall, the cloud resume challenge has been a great learning experience. Now onto my next project!</p>
